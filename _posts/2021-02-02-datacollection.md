# Overview 
Today we collected scattering patterns of BSA, $$\alpha$$-$$syn$$, caffine, $$\tau au$$ and amyloid beta using the prototype SAXS system. We were able to see clear scattering peaks for BSA and caffine, possible peaks for $$\alpha$$-$$syn$$, and no peaks for amyloid beta or $$\tau au$$. Following initial measurments,  we placed $$\tau au$$, $$\alpha$$-$$syn$$ and amyloid beta in an incubator in order to induce aggegation. We will complete measurments on the aggregated samples next tuesday after a week of incubation. 

# SAXS prototype

Because of the issues we had with SAXSpace, we decided to use the prototype version. It is a polycromatic version of the SAXSpace and much more intuitive to use. Because it is polycroomatic, it is significantly higher energy and can be used to probe much thicker samples (even though that is not relevent for our setup). However, for the same reason, it can only probe solid samples. 

The X-ray is an open system requiring the operator 

# Sample measurments 
For each sample we took two measurments each with an exposure time of 300 seconds. All samples were placed in a plastic srynge by (find company name). Background measurments of the srynge were also taken at the same exposure time. 
## Caffine 
We observed clear bragg peaks from the caffine sample. 
## BSA
## tau
Originally we thought we saw scattering from the tau sample but it turned out that it was just scattering off of the tip. 
## alpha synuclein 
## amyloid beta
