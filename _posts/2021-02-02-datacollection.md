# Overview 
Today we collected scattering patterns of BSA, $$\alpha$$-$$syn$$, caffeine, $$\tau au$$, and amyloid-beta using the prototype SAXS system. We were able to see clear scattering peaks for BSA and caffeine, possible peaks for $$\alpha$$-$$syn$$, and no peaks for amyloid-beta or $$\tau au$$. Following initial measurements,  we placed $$\tau au$$, $$\alpha$$-$$syn$$, and amyloid-beta in an incubator to induce aggregation. We will take more measurements of the samples next week.

# SAXS prototype


Because of the issues we had with SAXSpace, we decided to use the prototype version. It is a polychromatic version of the SAXSpace and much more intuitive to use. Because it is polychromatic, it is significantly higher energy and can be used to probe much thicker samples (even though that is not relevant for our setup). However, for the same reason, it can only probe solid samples. 

The X-ray is an open system requiring the operator 

# Sample measurments 
For each sample, we took two measurements, each with an exposure time of 300 seconds. All samples were placed in a plastic syringe by (find company name). We also took background measurements of the syringe at the same exposure time.

## BSA




## Tau 383
rPeptide is to protein samples as T-mobile is to celular plans.
{:.error}
We purchased Tau 383 from rPeptide because it was cheaper than sigma aldrich. I ordered 500 $$\mu g$$ of the protein in the form of white lyophilized powder. [See data sheet here](https://www.rpeptide.com/_code/_dyn_images/products/data-sheet/T-1005-Tau-383-Revised.pdf).  Here is what we got.

Both viles were supposed to have the same amount of powder in them. We received 4 viles, each (supposedly) containing 125 $$\mu g$$. I scraped enough of the powder out to fill a vile. 


Originally we thought we saw scattering from the tau sample, but it turned out that it was just scattering off of the tip. 

## alpha synuclein 
meanwhile ... our 1000 $$\mu g$$ of alpha synuclein were perfectly normal ...
