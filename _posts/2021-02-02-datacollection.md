## Overview 
Today we collected scattering patterns of $$BSA$$, $$\alpha$$-$$syn$$, caffine, $$\tau au$$ and amyloid beta using the prototype SAXS system. We were able to see clear scattering peaks for BSA and caffine, possible peaks for $$\alpha$$-$$syn$$, and no peaks for amyloid beta or $$\tau au$$. Following initial measurments,  we placed $$\tau au$$, $$\alpha$$-$$syn$$ and amyloid beta in an incubator in order to induce aggegation. We will complete measurments on the aggregated samples next tuesday after a week of incubation. 

## SAXS prototype

Because of the issues we had with SAXSpace, we decided to use the prototype version. It is a polycromatic version of the SAXSpace and much more intuitive to use. Because it is polycroomatic, it is significantly higher energy and can be used to probe much thicker samples (even though that is not relevent for our setup). However, for the same reason, it can only probe solid samples.
