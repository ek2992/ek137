## Detector information

<ol>
  <li>Make sure $\langleee^{-\sigma}\rangle$ = 1 * </li>
  <li>Entropy always increasing</li>
  <li>Check with Shiarashi bounds for thermally relaxing systems</li>
  <li>symetry - independent on ordering</li>
  
</ol>

## Integral fluctuation theorum 

The IFT must hold *except* when the probability of the reverse transition is not possible or if you violate detailed balance. For example, if you start your system in a delta function distribution, the IFT does not hold.

For more and more samples, the IFT should approach one. If it does not, reguardless of how close it is, something is wrong. 

## Average entropy production

Ensemble level entropy production has to always be increasing. Here are plots with error bars for more and more samples. 


## Target spins


## Ensemble probability

We  can also compare the probability distribution on the ensemble level to the value we get from exponentiating the rate matrix. 

## Information theoretic bounds
