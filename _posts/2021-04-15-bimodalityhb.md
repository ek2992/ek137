Here we explore the dynamics when each subsystem is connected to different heat baths. The difference in temperature between the subsystems will cause a current to flow, resulting in a non equilibrium steady state. 

Here are the questions we want to ask:

What conditions, (eg temperature, target subset, system size) cause bimodality.

How does the fitness depend on the temperature. Are there any conditions that cause decreases in fitness?

Does the system get stuck in a local minimum?
