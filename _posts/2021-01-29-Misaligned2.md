## Stardate 98671.69  

We spent today aligning the X-Ray beam. 

We went through all of the steps specified by SAXSquant. Everything worked until the sample adjustment stage, where we got an error saying "beam intensity is too low". A screen capture of the error is below.

In the meantime, I made a render of the system because it was fun.
