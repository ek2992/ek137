The Kaneko paper [here] attempted to model genotype phenotype evolution using spin system to represent the evolutionary process. We are extending their work by studdying the non equilibrium-dynamics of the evolutionary proces modeling the system as a continuous time Markov Chain. 


In their model, they represent the phenotypes as all ${\bf{S}}=[S_1...S_N] \in ({-1,+1})^{N}$ and the genotypes are the $J_{ij}$ interactions between the bits $S_{n}$.
