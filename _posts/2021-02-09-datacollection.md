# Post-aggregation results

Today we took measurments after letting our samples aggregate for a week following the procedure described in the last report. Once we toook them out of the incubator, the water had completely dried from the sample. It looked like this.

# Sample measurments 
For each sample, we took two measurements, each with an exposure time of 300 seconds just as before. This was a sad day. 

## Tau 383
There was just too little sample. Here is the attempt. 

## alpha synuclein

The peaks at 6.4 nm -1 and 13 nm-1 are below the line. There is also a peak at 21 m-1 but i am not sure what that is about.

## amyloid-beta

There is a peak at 6.4 nm. This is characteristic of the beta strandd distance. I know it is an ugly plot but i belive it is significant. I wish I got more measruments so I could calculate the error. I belive that if I took longer exposure measurments all with the quartz capillary then I would be able to determine more about it.
