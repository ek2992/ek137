# Post-aggregation results

Today we took measurments after letting our samples aggregate for a week following the procedure described in the last report. Once we toook them out of the incubator, the water had completely dried from the sample. It looked like this.

# Sample measurments 
For each sample, we took two measurements, each with an exposure time of 300 seconds just as before. This was a sad day. 

## Tau 383
There was just too little sample. Here is the attempt. 

## alpha synuclein 
We took a measurment at 300 seconds andd then noticed a small peak at 6.5 nm$^{-1}$. We re-took this measurment at 600 seconds of exposure. Ideally we would have gotten more than one measurment at each exposure.

## amyloid-beta
