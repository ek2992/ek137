## Procedure
Lowered the threshold value on detector to 916 and above. This corresponds to 27 keV and above. FYI threshold value can be changed in HEXITEC software. 
Started off by getting just beam measurement. 

X-ray and detector settings for following measurments 

| Current mA | Voltage kVp | exposure time (s) | threshold | beamstop |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   .2 ma | 50 kVp | 150s | 916 | no |

*HEXITEC DETECTOR PROCESSING SETUP. CHANGE THRESHOLD TO 916*

Took two measurments of open beam. 

# Open beam

| measurment # | file name |
| --- | --- |
|   I | 2021_feb16_0.2mA_150s_transmission_openbeam_I.hxt |
| II | 2021_feb16_0.2mA_150s_transmission_openbeam_II.hxt |


if oversaturates we can set beam to .1 mA but we were fine at .2 mA. 

## PMMA sample
First collected 1 cm measurment. Used 2 blocks of .5 cm PMMA slabs.


# 1 cm
two .5 cm blocks

Took two measurments at .2mA and 150s
two .5 cm blocks and one 2 cm block.
