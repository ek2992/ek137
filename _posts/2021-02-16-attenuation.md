 *HEXITEC DETECTOR PROCESSING SETUP. CHANGE THRESHOLD TO 916*



X-ray and detector settings for following measurments 

| Current  | Voltage | exposure time | threshold | beamstop |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   .2 ma | 50 kVp | 150 s | 916 | no |

 
# Open beam
![ Alt text](/files/beam.gif) 
Took two measurments of open beam.

if oversaturates we can set beam to .1 mA but we were fine at .2 mA.

## PMMA sample
First collected 1 cm measurment. Used 2 blocks of .5 cm PMMA slabs.


# 1 cm
