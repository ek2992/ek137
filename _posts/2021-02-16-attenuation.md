# Open beam
Lowered the threshold value on detector to 916 and above. This corresponds to 27 keV and above. FYI threshold value can be changed in HEXITEC software. 
Startedd off by getting just beam measurement.

*HEXITEC DETECTOR PROCESSING SETUP. CHANGE THRESHOLD TO 916*

Took two measurments of open beam. 
2021_feb16_0.2mA_150s_transmission_openbeam_I.hxt (measurment one)
2021_feb16_0.2mA_150s_transmission_openbeam_II.hxt (measurment two)

if oversaturates we can set beam to .1 mA but we were fine at .2 mA. 

## PMMA sample
First collected 1 cm measurment. Used 2 blocks of .5 cm PMMA slabs.


# 1 cm
two .5 cm blocks
2021_feb16_150s_0.2mA_transmission_PMMA_10mm_II.hxt
2021_feb16_150s_0.2mA_transmission_PMMA_10mm_I.hxt


# 3 cm

Took two measurments at .2mA and 150s
two .5 cm blocks and one 2 cm block.
