## Procedure
Changed threshold value on detector 116 to 916. This corresponds to 27 keV and above. These settings are in the HEXITEC software (HexitecGigE V1.1) ---> processing. 

We removed the beam stop

*beam stop was removed prior to measurments*


 

X-ray and detector settings for following measurments 

| Current  | Voltage | exposure time | threshold | beamstop |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   .2 ma | 50 kVp | 150 s | 916 | no |

Took two measurments of open beam.

if oversaturates we can set beam to .1 mA but we were fine at .2 mA. 

## PMMA sample
First collected 1 cm measurment. Used 2 blocks of .5 cm PMMA slabs.


# 1 cm
two .5 cm blocks

Took two measurments at .2mA and 150s
two .5 cm blocks and one 2 cm block.
