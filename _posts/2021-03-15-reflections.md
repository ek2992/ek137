In the future, there are several possible improvements to our experimental setup and analysis. 
## {Sample Preparation} 

In terms of sample preparation, the sample should have been immediately transferred to a quartz capillary. Quartz capillaries are known to have minimal scattering however are extremely extremely fragile and placing the sample is difficult. Additionally, the sample should not be moved into a different container after aggregation as this may ruin the crystallization. Additionally, we need to fine tune our aggregation procedure.

## {Validate with Other Techniques}
Ideally, we would verify aggregation with other techniques such as FTIR spectroscopy \citep{Miller2013}. This will allow us to determine whether our proteins are aggregated. Currently we have no way to determine whether we do not have enough sample or if the protein does not have a high enough $\beta$ sheet content.
## {More Measurements}

Additionally, multiple samples should be individually prepared and measured. This was not possible due to the cost of the proteins however this is crucial to confirm extremely low SNR signals. A possible avenue to explore are cheaper models that exhibit the same behavior as the target samples? Nevertheless, more measurements of our individual samples would help confirm some of the low SNR signals. In some samples, we only had one measurement after not seeing any signal. This was the case for $\mathrm{\alpha \mbox{-}synuclein}$. Further analyses revealed that there was a possible peak related to the $\beta $ sheet. However, a combination of too few measurements and poor sample container choice meant that no definitive statements could be drawn.

For example, when collecting the alpha syn measurments we only took one image at 300 seconds and one at 600 seconds. This was not idea. We should have made sure to keep the procedure consistent. Additionally, it would have been beneficial to take images at multiple expoosures to see if we were missing anything.
