# Overview 


# SAXS prototype


Because of the issues we had with SAXSpace, we decided to use the prototype version. It is a polychromatic version of the SAXSpace and much more intuitive to use. Because it is polychromatic, it is significantly higher energy and can be used to probe much thicker samples (even though that is not relevant for our setup). However, for the same reason, it can only probe solid samples. 

The X-ray is an open system requiring the operator 

# Sample measurments 
For each sample, we took two measurements, each with an exposure time of 300 seconds. All samples were placed in a plastic syringe by (find company name). We also took background measurements of the syringe at the same exposure time. 
## Caffeine
We observed clear Bragg peaks from the caffeine sample. 
## BSA

## Tau 383

Both viles were supposed to have the same amount of powder in them. We received 4 viles, each (supposedly) containing 125 $$\mu g$$. I scraped enough of the powder out to fill a vile. 


Originally we thought we saw scattering from the tau sample, but it turned out that it was just scattering off of the tip.

We had no expextation of seeing much from the the non aggregated samples of tau, alpha synuclein or amyloid beta. Following the measurments, we aggregat
