# Sample measurments 
For each sample, we took two measurements, each with an exposure time of 300 seconds. All samples were placed in a plastic syringe by (find company name). We also took background measurements of the syringe at the same exposure time. These are the pre-aggregated samples.

Both viles were supposed to have the same amount of powder in them. We received 4 viles, each (supposedly) containing 125 $$\mu g$$. I scraped enough of the powder out to fill a vile. 


Originally we thought we saw scattering from the tau sample, but it turned out that it was just scattering off of the tip.
