# Sample measurments 
For each sample, we took two measurements, each with an exposure time of 300 seconds. All samples were placed in a plastic syringe by (find company name). We also took background measurements of the syringe at the same exposure time.

We had no expextation of seeing much from the the non aggregated samples of tau, alpha synuclein or amyloid beta. Following the measurments, we aggregat
