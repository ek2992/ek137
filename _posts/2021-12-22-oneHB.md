  $$\frac{L{({p}(0),{p}(\tau))}^2}{2\sigma(\tau){\langle A\rangle}_{\tau}}\leq \tau$$

\begin{conditions}
 ${\langle A\rangle}_{\tau}$     & $\frac{1}{\tau}\int_{0}^{\tau}$. This is the dynamical activity or number of transitions over a given time  \\
 N     &  number of waves \\   
 S_{d} &  damage level

# Stress tests 

# Target spin symetry 
Due to symmetry, the entropy production will be the same regardless of the order of target spins. For example, target spins 123 and 432 will produce the same results. This is the first stress test!
