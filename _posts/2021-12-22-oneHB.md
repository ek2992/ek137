Shiraishi and Saito [2019] derived a stronger bound on the entropy production for a thermally relaxing system.

$\sigma_{(0,\tau)}\geq D\left({\bf{p}}(0)||{\bf{p}}(\tau)\right)$
Here are examples of this bound for different temperatures and the same target configuration.

# Stress tests 

## Target spin symetry 
Due to symmetry, the entropy production will be the same regardless of the order of target spins.

**Example**
$$M_{012}=\boxed{\boxed{S_{0}} \quad  \boxed{S_{1}} \quad \boxed{S_{2}} \quad S_{3}\quad S_{4}}$$

$$M_{124}=\boxed{{S_{0} \quad  \boxed{S_{1}} \quad \boxed{S_{2}} \quad S_{3}\quad \boxed{S_{4}}}$$

These two configurations should produce the same EP plots... and indeed... they do!
