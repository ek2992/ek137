# Bimodality

One heat bath produces noisier EP plots: here is an example for T=1.

Here is what happens when the some heat baths are changed. (the third and the fourth were changed to 1.2: I will update this with a better plot and correct scale)

When the temperature is greater, the bimodality is less noticable. I will include this after:



# Bounds 

## Speed limit theorums 

### Farita speed limits 




## Information Theoretic bounds (for thermally relaxing systems)

Shiraishi and Saito [2019] derived a stronger bound on the entropy production for a thermally relaxing system.

$\sigma_{(0,\tau)}\geq D\left({\bf{p}}(0)||{\bf{p}}(\tau)\right)$
Here are examples of this bound for different temperatures and the same target configuration.
