## Bimodality 

One heat bath produces noisier EP plots: here is an example for T=1.

## Bounds 

# Speed limit theorums 




## Information Theoretic bounds (for thermally relaxing systems)

Shiraishi and Saito [2019] derived a stronger bound on the entropy production for a thermally relaxing system.

$\sigma_{(0,\tau)}\geq D\left({\bf{p}}(0)||{\bf{p}}(\tau)\right)$
Here are examples of this bound for different temperatures and the same target configuration.
