measured weights of sample by getting weight of empty sryinge and then filled sample.  Measured weight of sample in scale (did not get name) of scale. Did not take multiple measurments of sample. This bad. 

MEASURED WEIGHT OF SAMPLE WITH ONLY ONE MEASURMENT PER CONTAINER. IN FUTURE TAKE MULTIPLE.

This is not a good way to find weight. We measured the weight if a different srynge, however we shouldd have measured multiple srynges too see how much they vary. It is very possible that the srynge weight fluctuates by more than 1000 micrograms.

| Sample+container | total mg | sample mg |
| --- | --- |
| `Tau + srynge` |1335.3 mg |  12.2 mg |
| `$alpha$-syn +srynge` | 1323.9 mg | .8 mg |
| `$\beta$-amyloid +srynge` | 1324.9 mg | 1.8 mg|
| `srynge only` | 1323.1 mg | -- |

Obviously these measurements make no sense. There is no way that the sample weighs more than the weight they told us. I either made a mistake in writing the mass oof tau +srynge down or just ignored it when taking the measurment. Moost likely I miswote something. 

 100 microliters of solution in the alpha synuclein sample 
 100 microliters of solution in the tau sample 
 200 microliters of solution in the $\beta$-amyloid  sample 



Then we put the samples (in the plastic containers) in an incubator and set it to 40$^{\circ}C$. When we put the sample in, it was at 38$^{\circ}C$.

Sample placed in incubator at 4:33 pm 2/2/2021.
