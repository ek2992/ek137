Here we are checking the TUR's. The goal here is to understand, for our specific model when these bounds are the tightest. The point of the thermodynamic uncertanty relations is to understand the efficiency of a non equilibrium process. 

Liu and eueda: 

We find that the variance of an accumulated current is bounded by the instantaneous Â´
current at the final time


First, we are using entropy production as the current flow. 
$$\simga=\int_{0^{\tau}dt\Sugma_{J\neq J', v}P(J;t} W_{J,J'}ln\frac{P(x;t}W_{J,J'}}{P(J';t)W_{J',J}}$$

Here J(\omega)=\Sum_
where $\omega$ is a trajectory
$$J(\omega)=\Sum_{J\neq J',\nu}=n^{\nu}_{J,J'}[w]d^{\nu}(J,J')$$
where $d^{\nu}_{J,J'}$ is  an antisymetrix increment associated with $\J\rightarrow J'$

One can easily define $d^{\nu}_{J,J'}$ to be $\sigma$ where $\sigma = ep definition$



$$\frac{Var(J)}{Tj(\tau))}^2\sigma \geq 2$$

You can understand current between two states $J$ and $J'$ to be $p(J')W_{J,J'}-p(J)W_{J',J}$ This is the net rate of transitions from state $J \rightarrow J'$
.
## EP

for the EP the bound becomes 

$$\frac{var[J]}{\sigma}\geq 2$$
