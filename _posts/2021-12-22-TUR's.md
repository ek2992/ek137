Here we are checking the TUR's

Liu and eueda: 

We find that the variance of an accumulated current is bounded by the instantaneous Â´
current at the final time


First, we are using entropy production as the current flow. 
$$\simga=\int_{0^{\tau}dt\Sugma_{J\neq J', v}P(J;t} W_{J,J'}ln\frac{P(x;t}W_{J,J'}}{P(J';t)W_{J',J}}$$

Here J(\omega)=\Sum_
where $\omega$ is a trajectory
$$J(\omega)=\Sum_{J\neq J',\nu}=n^{\nu}_{J,J'}[w]d^{\nu}(J,J')$$
where $d^{\nu}_{J,J'}$ is  an antisymetrix increment associated with $\J\rightarrow J'$

One can easily define $d^{\nu}_{J,J'}$ to be $\sigma$ where $\sigma = ep definition$



$$\frac{Var(J)}{Tj(\tau))}^2\sigma \geq 2$$
