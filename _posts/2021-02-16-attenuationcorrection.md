# Attenuation Correction

Today we took measurments to account for attenuation. Attenuation occurs when an X-ray beam interacts with matter therefore reducing its intensity.
$I=I_oe^{-\mu}{x}$


# Correcting 

# Sample measurments 
For each sample, we took two measurements, each with an exposure time of 300 seconds. All samples were placed in a plastic syringe by (find company name). We also took background measurements of the syringe at the same exposure time. These are the pre-aggregated samples.

## Tau 383
we did not get transmission measurments for tau :(

The peak looked like it was from the tip, not the sample. We repositioned the empty sample container so the x-ray beam was hitting the tip. This confirmed that the peak was from the container not the sample.
