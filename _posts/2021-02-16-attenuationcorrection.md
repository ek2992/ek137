# Attenuation Correction

Today we took measurments to account for attenuation. Attenuation occurs when an X-ray beam interacts with matter therefore reducing its intensity.
$I=I_oe^{-\mu}{x}$


# Correcting 

# Sample measurments 
For each sample, we took two measurements, each with an exposure time of 300 seconds. All samples were placed in a plastic syringe by (find company name). We also took background measurements of the syringe at the same exposure time. These are the pre-aggregated samples.

## Tau 383

Both viles were supposed to have the same amount of powder in them. We received 4 viles, each (supposedly) containing 125 $$\mu g$$. I scraped enough of the powder out to fill a vile. 


Originally we thought we saw scattering from the tau sample, but it turned out that it was just scattering off of the tip.

The peak looked like it was from the tip, not the sample. We repositioned the empty sample container so the x-ray beam was hitting the tip. This confirmed that the peak was from the container not the sample.
