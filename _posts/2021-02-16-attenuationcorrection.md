# Attenuation Correction

Today we took measurments to account for attenuation. Attenuation occurs when an X-ray beam interacts with matter therefore reducing its intensity.
$I=I_oe^{-\mu}{x}$


# Correcting 

# Sample measurments 
For each sample, we took two measurements, each with an exposure time of 300 seconds. All samples were placed in a plastic syringe by (find company name). We also took background measurements of the syringe at the same exposure time. 
## Caffeine

There are clear bragg peaks at 8.32 and 18.59 nm−1 These peaks correspond to the
the 7.53–7.40 Å and 3.37–3.30 atomic spacings of caffeine. 

## BSA

There are clear bragg peaks at 6.4 and 14 nm−1 These first peak corresponds to the $\beta-$sheet difference and the second corresponds to the $\beta$-strand distance. 

## Tau 383
we did not get transmission measurments for tau :( There was just too little sample.

## alpha synuclein

The peaks at 6.4 nm -1 and 13 nm-1 are below the line. There is also a peak at 21 m-1 but i am not sure what that is about.

## amyloid-beta

There is a peak at 6.4 nm. This is characteristic of the beta strandd distance. I know it is an ugly plot but i belive it is significant. I wish I got more measruments so I could calculate the error. I belive that if I took longer exposure measurments all with the quartz capillary then I would be able to determine more about it.
