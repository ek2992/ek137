## Stardate 98671.69  

The transitions from one genotype to the next are due to one spin/bit flipping. This means that each spin - NOT GENOTYPE - is connected to its own heat bath. I was wondering if this "temperature" can be thought of as the free energy difference between two base pairs in DNA.

I assign different temperatures to the rate matrix as follows

```python
class HyperCubeRateMatrix(RateMatrix):
    def topology(self):
        hypercube = torch.sparse_coo_tensor([[0, 1], [1, 0]], [1, 1], [2, 2], dtype=torch.short)
        hypercube=hypercube*(1/self.sub_temps[0])
        for i in range(1, self.G):
            eye = sparse_eye(2 ** i)*(1/self.sub_temps[i])
            hypercube = torch.cat([torch.cat([hypercube, eye], dim=1), torch.cat([eye, hypercube], dim=1)], dim=0)
        hypercube = hypercube.type(self.dtype)
        return hypercube
```
What this is doing is multplying the diagnoal components of the rate matrix by a $\beta$, the inverse temperature. The diagonal components correspond to transitions due to one bit flip. 

To check that this is correct, I made sure the rate matrix this method produced was the same as the previous method, if the all the subsystem temperatures are the same. Check! 

To understand why the diagonals gives you the all possible one bit transitions just take a look at a hypercube! All parallel edges are transitions due to one bit.
