## Stardate 98671.69  

The transitions from one genotype to the next are due to one spin/bit flipping. This means that each spin - NOT GENOTYPE - is connected to its own heat bath. I was wondering if this "temperature" can be thought of as the free energy difference between two base pairs in DNA.

I assign different temperatures to the rate matrix as follows

```python
class HyperCubeRateMatrix(RateMatrix):
    def topology(self):
        hypercube = torch.sparse_coo_tensor([[0, 1], [1, 0]], [1, 1], [2, 2], dtype=torch.short)
        hypercube=hypercube*(1/self.sub_temps[0])
        for i in range(1, self.G):
            eye = sparse_eye(2 ** i)*(1/self.sub_temps[i])
            hypercube = torch.cat([torch.cat([hypercube, eye], dim=1), torch.cat([eye, hypercube], dim=1)], dim=0)
        hypercube = hypercube.type(self.dtype)
        return hypercube
```
