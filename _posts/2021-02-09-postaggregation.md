# Overview 
Coming back after leaving protiens in incubator for a week.

*Sample after aggregation*


## Measurments 

# Caffeine 
Caffeine measurments as system check. 

2021_feb9_1mA_300s_caffeinetest_original_I.hxt (measurment one)
2021_feb9_1mA_300s_syringe_empty1.hxt ( empty syringe )

all good! Only took one measurment. 

# $\alpha$-syn
Aggregating resulted in a fibril like structure. The fibrils were very dispersed throughout the sample so I tried to put move by tapping on the syringe. I was stopped just in time but... idiot moment (that will ruin the fibrils)

After the first measurment 300 seconds, took another measurment at 600 seconds. Did not see anything so took another measurement at 600 seconds and accidentally overwrote the second measurement. 

2021_feb9_1mA_300s_asyn_aggregate_stepI.hxt (first measrument) 
2021_feb9_1mA_600s_asyn_aggregate_stepII.hxt (second measurment) 

2021_feb9_1mA_300s_syringe_empty1.hxt (empty container)

2021_feb9_1mA_300s_alpha_quartz_aggregate_stepI.hxt
2021_feb9_1mA_300s_alpha_quartz_background_stepI.hxt
2021_feb9_1mA_300s_quartz_empty1.hxt

Did not take an addditional background measurement at 600s. Multiplied the background by 2 instead. 

# amyloid-$\beta$


2021_feb9_1mA_300s_ab42ag_aggregate_I.hxt
2021_feb9_1mA_300s_ab42ag_aggregate_stepI.hxt
2021_feb9_1mA_300s_ab42ag_aggregate_stepII.hxt

2021_feb9_1mA_300s_abquartz_aggregate_stepI.hxt
2021_feb9_1mA_300s_abquartz_aggregate_stepII.hxt

# Tau
barely enough sample to see.
