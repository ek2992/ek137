# Overview 
Coming back after leaving protiens in incubator for a week.

*Sample after aggregation*


## Measurments 

# Caffeine 
Caffeine measurments as system check. We verified a peak at 
| Measurement # | File name (caffeine sample) |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 2021_feb9_1mA_300s_caffeinetest_original_I.hxt |

background (plastic srynge) 

| Measurement # | File name (plastic syringe) |

all good! Only took one measurment. Observed peaks at 8.4 and 18.7 $1/nm$

# $\alpha$-syn
Aggregating resulted in a fibril like structure. The fibrils were very dispersed throughout the sample so I tried to put move by tapping on the syringe. I was stopped just in time but... idiot moment (that will ruin the fibrils)

After the first measurment 300 seconds, took another measurment at 600 seconds. Did not see anything so took another measurement at 600 seconds and accidentally overwrote the second measurement.

--> same container as caffeine. Shoud have been consistent and taken two measurments. (2021_feb9_1mA_300s_syringe_empty1.hxt (empty container))


We decided to move the sample over to a quartz capillary to prevent scattering from tip of srynge and to have a uniform sample thickness.

*mis-named. Will change to aggregate step 2. I am not sure why I did that? ***turns out this measurment is something else than what I called it and wrote in my lab notebook. I have to ignore it now.***

ONLY TOOK ONE MEASURMENT OF QUARTZ BACKGROUND. :,(

Did not take an addditional background measurement at 600s. Multiplied the background by 2 instead.

2021_feb9_1mA_300s_ab42ag_aggregate_I.hxt was taken too close to the tip. We repositioned and started over.

did not see anything promising so left it at one measurment.

# Tau
barely enough sample to see.
